## Introduction and Research Background
### Pedestrian Counting System Background
The City of Melbourne is the local council which overseas what many would consider to be the heart of Melbourne. It spans a wide area range from the postcodes of Port Melbourne to Flemington, Cartlon, and South Yarra. It contains several of Melbourne's most important landmarks such as the Royal Botanical Garderns as well as important areas of economic activity like the Melbourne CBD.

With so much going on in the City of Melbourne it is probably not too suprising to learn that they been monitoring pedestrian activity within their council since at least 2009 through their Pedestrian Counting System. The aims of the Pedestrian Counting System, as stated by the City of Melbourne are to:
- inform decisions about urban planning and management
- identify opportunities to improve city walkability and transport
- measure the impacts of events and specific marketing campaigns on pedestrian activity
- monitor retail activity in the city
- assist the business community in developing marketing strategies to maximise their exposure and identify staffing, security and resource requirements.

### Our Research and Scope
Like every part of the country, the area within the City of Melbourne has been strongly affected by the disruptions to daily social and ecnomic life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with research by Deloitte estimating that the Melbourne CBD economy is not expected to bounce back until late 2024 (City of Melbourne, 2021). With this in mind, we wanted examine changes to pedestrian activity both shortly before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine possible influences on it during this time period. We limited the scope of our base data to pedestrian activity the two two years between August 2019 (around 7-8 before the pandemic arrived in Australia) and August 2021.

From this base data, as well as data provided by labour force statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the Australian Department of Treasury, we sort to answer the following broad sets of questions

- Hypothesis One: the overall pedestrian activity in the CBD has decreased since March 2020 when the first lockdown happened in Melbourne.

- Hypothesis Two: pedestrian activity increased after the first lockdown, but not to pre-pandemic levels (average of August 2019 to February 2020).

- Hypothesis Three: Pedestrian activity has decreased since the scaling back of Job Keeper.

- Hypothesis Four: Pedestrian activity increases as the number of Victorian part-time workers increases.

- Hypothesis Five: Pedestrian activity increases as the number of Victorian full-time workers increases.
