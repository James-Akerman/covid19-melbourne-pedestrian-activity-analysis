# Pedestrian activity in the City of Melbourne before and during COVID-19
 Please run the code in the following order.
 
## Step 1: Modify the "api_keys_tokens.py" file in the *Hypotheses 3 and 4* folder
Update the variables **MyAppToken** and **google_key** by following the instructions below.

##### google_key
Insert your Google Maps API key in here.
If you require instructions for setting up a Google Maps API key, please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_HZObVbe-g&t=10s) or read this [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

4) Copy your app token.

## Step 2: Go inside the *Hypothesis 1* folder

**Hypothesis One:** The overall pedestrian activity in the City of Melbourne had decreased since March 2020 when the first lockdown happened in Melbourne.

The **data exploration** and **data analysis** is reported in **Hypotheses 1 - Prabh_analysis.ipynb**.

Results are exported to the folder 'Hypothesis1/Analysis' which includes csv and png files.


1) Run the "Prabh_analysis.ipynb" file.


## Step 3: Go inside the *Hypothesis 2 and 5* folder


**Hypothesis Two:** Pedestrian activity had increased after the first lockdown, but not to pre-pandemic levels (average of August 2019 to February 2020).

**Hypothesis Five:** Pedestrian activity increases as the number of Victorian full-time workers increases.

### If **API key is available**, 
add a keys.py file with api_keys variable and run the following file:
**DataGatheringViaAPI.ipynb**
### else, run the following scripts:
The **data exploration** and wrangling process is reported in **Hypotheses 2 and 5 - data_exploration.ipynb**
- Data Frames needed for Data Analysis have been locally stored in .csv format also to avoid dependency on API keys.

For **data analysis** with illustrations and stats, the report is in **Hypotheses 2 and 5 - DataAnalysis.ipynb**

1) Run the "data_exploration.ipynb" file.

2) Run the "DataAnalysis.ipynb" file.



## Step 4: Go inside the *Hypotheses 3 and 4* folder

**Hypothesis Three:** Pedestrian activity would increase as JobKeeper claims increased.

**Hypothesis Four:** Pedestrian activity would decrease after JobKeeper was tapered.


1) Run the "Hypotheses 3 and 4 - Data Wrangling.ipynb" file.

2) Run the "Hypotheses 3 and 4 - Analysis.ipynb" file.
