**Conclusion:**

There was an average drop of 87% in pedestrian activity at various locations in Melbourne during covid19.

Since the first lockdown, the pedestrian activity has still not returned to pre-lockdown which might suggest a new trend.

The negative correlation found in most postcodes may be because businesses were struggling to pay their workers as the number of pedestrians and hence customers decreased.

No statistically conclusive evidence of pedestrian numbers decreasing after JobKeeper. Apparent decline maybe due to chance.

Full time workers were still active during years affected by lockdown.
