#### Run the Hypotheses 3 and 4 - Data Wrangling.ipynb file

#### Run the Hypotheses 3 and 4 - Analysis.ipynb file

### Hypothesis 2 and 5
**Hypothesis Two:** Pedestrian activity had increased after the first lockdown, but not to pre-pandemic levels (average of August 2019 to February 2020).

**Hypothesis Five:** Pedestrian activity increases as the number of Victorian full-time workers increases.

The data exploration and wrangling process is reported in data_exploration.ipynb
- Data Frames needed for Data Analysis have been locally stored in .csv format also to avoid dependency on API keys.
For data analysis with illustrations and stats, the report is in DataAnalysis.ipynb


**Conclusion:**

There was an average drop of 87% in pedestrian activity at various locations in Melbourne during covid19.

Since the first lockdown, the pedestrian activity has still not returned to pre-lockdown which might suggest a new trend.

The negative correlation found in most postcodes may be because businesses were struggling to pay their workers as the number of pedestrians and hence customers decreased.

No statistically conclusive evidence of pedestrian numbers decreasing after JobKeeper. Apparent decline maybe due to chance.

Full time workers were still active during years affected by lockdown.
